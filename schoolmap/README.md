## IS THIS MY SCHOOL? FUN hahhhhh

## Usage
Go to the first column of dropmenu, load location points. Left click on point to set the start place while right click on point to set the end place(click again to cancel the choose). Double click on the view to let the code line the start and end place up using dijstra algrithm. Maybe that's it. And that serves my not so cool homework.......
